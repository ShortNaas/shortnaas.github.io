A book about creative struggles and the resistance that holds us.   
I was amazed and connected with the book. I feel like I have found a puzzle missing in my life.

## Actionable Takeaways
- Ignore the voice inside you telling you to quit and stick to your work, that's the hardest part.
- Stop consuming products and work since that's the best way to beat resistance.
- Fear tells us what we have to do. If it scares you it's time to do it.
- Learn the technique, figure out the how, you'll have the arsenal when inspiration strikes.
- Use criticisms to learn and grow.
- Don't let others to validate your efforts or calling. Remember Van Gogh never found a buyer in his whole life.
- You can only control your work, how much effort you can put not the results. 

## NOTES
It's not the writing part that's hard. What's hard is sitting down to write.  

Resistance is the enemy within.

The warrior and the artist live by the same code of necessity, which dictates that the battle must be fought anew every day.

Instead of applying self-knowledge, self-discipline, delayed gratification, and hard work, we simply consume a product.

While those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them.

Fear tells us what we have to do.

Seeking support from friends and family is like having your people gathered around at your deathbed.

The artist committing himself to his calling has volunteered for hell.

The professional masters how, and leaves what and why to the gods.

The most important thing about art is to work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying

Are you a born writer? Were you put on earth to be a painter, a scientist, an apostle of peace? In the end the question can only be answered by action.

Procrastination is the most common manifestation of Resistance because it's the easiest to rationalize.

Fear of throwing away the education, the training, the preparation that those we love have sacrificed so much for, that we ourselves have worked our butts off for.

When Krishna instructed Arjuna that we have a right to our labor but not to the fruits of our labor, he was counseling the warrior to act territorially, not hierarchically.  
Then there's the third way proffered by the Lord of Discipline, which is beyond both hierarchy and territory  
That is to do the work and give it to Him. Do it as an offering to God. 

Friends sometimes ask, "Don't you get lonely sitting by yourself all day?" At first it seemed odd to hear myself answer No. Then I realized that I was not alone; I was in the book; I was with the characters. I was with my Self.

The professional gives an ear to criticism, seeking to learn and grow

The Self wishes to create, to evolve. The Ego likes things just the way they are

Dreams come from the Self. Ideas come from the Self. When we meditate we access the Self. When we fast, when we pray, when we go on a vision quest, it's the Self we're seeking

Creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor.   
It's a gift to the world and every being in it. Don't cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you've got.
