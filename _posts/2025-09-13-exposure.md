Exposure, something I realized today.  I listened to [Kendrick's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar) DAMN album when I was in high school. Back then, I didn't listen to Rap and Hip-Hop, so I didn't enjoy the song. I just listened to it once and threw it away.  

It wasn't until this year that I started listening to him again, because I was listening to a little bit of Rap music, I transitioned from [NF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NF_(rapper)) to [M&M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem).  

I just opened his whole song and let it play in the background; it was an unfamiliar sound for me. It's not that I didn't like it, it's just a language I didn't understand.  

But after a few months of exposure, I listened to some songs I found interesting. I'm now in a marathon of listening to his albums and songs on repeat. I haven't listened to them all well, but I can relate and understand the language.  

This thing can happen to anything, on things that could damage me too. It has happened several times before.  

But the realization of this can help me do more of what I want. **Expose myself to the things I want to do more of**, and slowly consume something relatable, something I would like to do. When that motivation sparks, I go full throttle. I can sit down and work for hours without getting tired. I feel nothing, focused and intense work.
